# wordle
Python Code for a Wordle game played in the terminal

Welcome to Wordle!  
You get 6 tries to guess the 5 letter word  
If a letter is correct it will be shown as the letter: i.e. _ _ a _ _  
If a letter is correct but in the wrong place it will be shown as a ' * ': i.e.  _ _ * _ _  
If a letter is wrong it will be shown as a ' _ ': i.e. _ _ _ _ _  
If the word is not on the word list, or is not 5 letters long, you will be asked to guess again.  
Hint: There can be double letters!  

This is my adaptation of the NYT wordle game. The words list is adapted from Donald Knuth's GraphBase list of five-letter words, Respository link: https://github.com/charlesreid1/five-letter-words/tree/master
